//***FILE 734 is the original version of the PDS command, which     *   FILE 734
//*           still works, but which is being included here for     *   FILE 734
//*           nostalgia only.  The version of PDS on File 182,      *   FILE 734
//*           having been improved for so many years by Bruce       *   FILE 734
//*           Leland, Steve Smith, and John Kalinich, is so much    *   FILE 734
//*           better (and it now has PDSE support from Greg Price)  *   FILE 734
//*           that you shouldn't even THINK of using this version.  *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           However, this is the version that I used to use on    *   FILE 734
//*           MVT, and it brings back very pleasant memories of     *   FILE 734
//*           a time gone by.  Try it and dream of the old days,    *   FILE 734
//*           way, way before any programmers ever got laid off     *   FILE 734
//*           (and way before any IBM'ers got laid off either).     *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           Think 1975 !!!                                        *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           But in a pinch, this program, renamed PDSORIG to      *   FILE 734
//*           avoid conflicts with any later and better versions,   *   FILE 734
//*           still works, and can still bail you out.  It is a     *   FILE 734
//*           tribute to the longevity of the old OS/360 design.    *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           All the best to all of you ...... (SG - 01/03/2006)   *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           Please note that ISPF statistics did not exist then,  *   FILE 734
//*           so that SSI information for source modules does not   *   FILE 734
//*           report correctly when ISPF statistics exist instead,  *   FILE 734
//*           while using the ATTR subcommand.                      *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           Just for laughs......                                 *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
//*           Let me paraphrase a SYS1.BRODCAST message that I      *   FILE 734
//*           saw when I was working on MVT (long ago):             *   FILE 734
//*           "We're sorry, but we felt it necessary to put a       *   FILE 734
//*           password on SYS1.UADS last November."  This gives     *   FILE 734
//*           you an idea about security, during the time we're     *   FILE 734
//*           talking about.  (I was working at the Federal         *   FILE 734
//*           Reserve Bank of New York at the time, no less!)       *   FILE 734
//*           The PDS program was a life-saver, even then.          *   FILE 734
//*           (SG - 09/15/2022)                                     *   FILE 734
//*                                                                 *   FILE 734
